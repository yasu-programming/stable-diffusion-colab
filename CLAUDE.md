# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized repository for a Stable Diffusion Colab project. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file and git initialization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is minimal with:
- README.md: Basic project description
- .git/: Git repository metadata
- .claude/: Claude Code configuration directory

## Development Setup

This appears to be a fresh repository without established build tools, dependencies, or development workflows yet. Future development will likely involve:
- Setting up Python environment for Stable Diffusion
- Adding Jupyter notebooks for Colab integration
- Installing ML/AI dependencies (torch, transformers, diffusers, etc.)
- Configuring model downloading and caching

## Architecture Notes

The project is in its initial state. Architecture decisions and patterns will emerge as development progresses.
